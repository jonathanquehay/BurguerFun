I have made the necessary adjustments to the `style.css` file to address the mobile menu issues, added a dedicated close button, and a favicon.

Specifically, I have:
- Added `outline: none; box-shadow: none;` to the `.burger-icon:focus` style to eliminate the "blue box" that appears on focus.
- Modified the `.nav-links` styles to ensure the mobile menu (when active):
    - Covers the full screen (`position: fixed; top: 0; right: 0; width: 100%; height: 100vh;`).
    - Appears above other content (`z-index: 19;`).
    - Has an opaque background (`background-color: #1a202c;`).
    - Positions its content correctly below the fixed header (`padding-top: 60px;`).
    - Allows scrolling for long menus (`overflow-y: auto;`).
- Corrected the CSS selectors for the burger icon's toggle animation (`.burger-icon.toggle .line1`, `.burger-icon.toggle .line2`, `.burger-icon.toggle .line3`) to ensure the hamburger icon transforms into an "X" when the menu is open and back again when closed.
- Added a dedicated close button (`<button class="close-menu-btn">`) with a Font Awesome cross icon to the mobile menu in all HTML files.
- Updated `main.js` to add an event listener to this new close button, allowing it to close the mobile menu.
- **Replaced the image-based favicon with a direct hamburger emoji favicon (🍔) using a data URI in all HTML files.**

**To verify the fixes:**
1.  Open any HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) in your browser.
2.  **You should see a hamburger emoji (🍔) as the favicon in your browser tab.**
3.  Resize your browser window to a mobile viewport size, or use your browser's developer tools to simulate a mobile device.
4.  Click on the hamburger icon (burger-icon) in the header to open the menu.

You should observe that:
-   No blue box appears around the hamburger icon when you click it.
-   The mobile menu slides in from the right, covering the main content, and the links are clearly visible.
-   The hamburger icon transforms into an "X" when the menu is open.
-   A new "X" close button is visible in the top-right corner of the open mobile menu.
5.  Click on the new "X" close button within the mobile menu.

You should observe that:
-   The mobile menu closes smoothly.
-   The "X" close button disappears as the menu closes.
-   The hamburger icon transforms back into its original form.

Please let me know if you encounter any further issues!
